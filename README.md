The @Entity annotation in Java is used to mark a class as an entity, which means it represents a table in a relational database. 

The @Id annotation in Java is used to specify the primary key of an entity. It marks a field or property within an entity class as the identifier for instances of that class.

The @MappedBy annotation in JPA (Java Persistence API) is used to specify the inverse side bidirectional relationship between two entities,  to specify one side as the owning side (@ManyToOne or @OneToOne side) and the other side as the inverse side (@OneToMany or @OneToOne(mappedBy = " ") side).

The @JoinColumn annotation in JPA (Java Persistence API) is used to specify the column in the database table that is used to establish a relationship between two entities in a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping.

@GeneratedValue This used to generate primary key values for the entity.
